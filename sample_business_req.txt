1. What are the top 10 channels by subscriber count?
Recommended Visual: Bar Chart
Plot a bar chart displaying the top 10 channels by subscriber count, sorted in descending order.
This will highlight the most popular channels in terms of subscribers.

2. What is the distribution of grades across channels?
Recommended Visual: Pie Chart or Donut Chart
Use a pie chart or donut chart to visualize the distribution of grades among the channels, 
showing the proportion of each grade. Alternatively, use a bar chart if you prefer a more straightforward visual.

3. What is the relationship between the number of video uploads and subscribers?
Recommended Visual: Scatter Chart
Create a scatter plot with "Video Uploads" on the x-axis and "Subscribers" on the y-axis. 
This visual will help you see if there's a trend or correlation between content volume and subscriber count.

4. Which channels have the highest average views per video?
Recommended Visual: Bar Chart or Table
Use a bar chart to display the top 10 channels with the highest average views per video, or a table with conditional 
formatting to highlight the highest averages. This shows which channels have the most engagement per video.

5. How does the number of video uploads vary with total video views?
Recommended Visual: Scatter Chart
Create a scatter plot with "Video Uploads" on the x-axis and "Video Views" on the y-axis. 
This will allow you to explore if there is a pattern or correlation between uploads and total views.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is the distribution of average views per video across channels?
Recommended Visual: Histogram
Use a histogram to display the distribution of average views per video. 
This can help you see if there are common ranges or outliers in average views per video. 
If Power BI doesn’t support histograms directly, use a bar chart with binning applied to the "Average Views" column.

7. What is the relationship between subscribers and video views?
Recommended Visual: Scatter Chart with Trend Line
Use a scatter chart with "Subscribers" on the x-axis and "Video Views" on the y-axis, 
and add a trend line to identify the correlation between these two metrics. 
This helps you understand if more subscribers typically mean more views.

8. How do the top channels compare in terms of engagement (average views per video)?
Recommended Visual: Bar Chart or Stacked Column Chart
Create a bar chart to compare average views per video for the top 10 ranked channels. 
This will help you see if high-ranking channels also have high engagement on average.

9. How do the top 5000 channels distribute by rank across grades?
Recommended Visual: Box and Whisker Chart or Violin Plot (if available, otherwise a Clustered Column Chart)
Use a box and whisker chart or a violin plot to show the distribution of ranks within each grade. 
If these visuals aren’t available in Power BI, use a clustered column chart with rank bins to represent each grade.

10. Which grades dominate in terms of total video views?
Recommended Visual: Stacked Bar Chart or Treemap
Aggregate "Video Views" by grade and use a stacked bar chart or treemap to display which grades 
contribute the most to total views. This visual shows the influence of each grade on overall YouTube views.

Each of these visuals can be created with Power BI's built-in features, and you can add interactivity (e.g., slicers) 
to filter by additional dimensions like region, channel name, or upload frequency for more detailed insights.
